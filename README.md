<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://github.com/JDaniielC/argente123/blob/main/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm José Daniel</h1>

I'm 24 years old. I have a passion for technology and I'm always seeking to learn more.

## 📚 Currently Learning...

I'm focused on enhancing my skills as a developer. I'm exploring various technologies and programming languages to expand my knowledge and experience.

## 🌱 My Projects

I invite you to explore my individual projects here on GitHub. Feel free to collaborate, provide feedback, or ask questions. I believe we can learn a lot from each other!

## 🚀 My Learning Journey

I started studying programming in March 2021 and have been dedicated to learning and growing in this field ever since. I'm excited to see where this journey will take me!
